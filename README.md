# sdf_tools

Builds 2D signed distance fields from images, 3D signed distance fields from pointclouds, 3D signed distance fields from Octomap, provides a lightweight signed distance field library, message types for signed distance fields, and tools to compress signed distance fields for transport.

A simple example/tutorial is provided, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/WPI-ARC/sdf_tools/wiki).
